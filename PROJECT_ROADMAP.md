# Zephyryn Encryption/Decryption Platform: Project Roadmap

---

## 1. Project Summary

Zephyryn is a secure, end-to-end encrypted communication and data protection platform. It enables users to:
- Chat securely (text, files)
- Encrypt/decrypt files and text
- Make encrypted voice and video calls

All data is encrypted client-side, ensuring privacy and security for all users.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **UI/UX:** Responsive, mobile-optimized, accessible
- **State Management:** React hooks, context
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage for chat and encryption history

### 2.2 Backend
- **Server:** Node.js, Express
- **Real-Time:** Socket.IO for chat and calls
- **Encryption:** All sensitive data encrypted before transmission

### 2.3 Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM:** For all messages, files, and text
- **Key Management:** User-provided or session-based keys
- **No Plaintext Storage:** Data is only decrypted on the client

### 2.4 Voice/Video Calls
- **WebRTC:** Peer-to-peer, encrypted audio/video
- **TURN/STUN:** For NAT traversal
- **Automatic Permissions:** Camera/mic requested as needed

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Secure Chat
- One-to-one, end-to-end encrypted chat
- File sharing (encrypted)
- Persistent chat history (local)

### 3.2 File & Text Encryption
- Encrypt/decrypt any file or text
- Download/share encrypted files
- No data leaves the device unencrypted

### 3.3 Voice & Video Calls
- Peer-to-peer, encrypted calls
- Video and audio streams encrypted
- Mute, speaker, and video toggle

## 4. User Flow

1. **Login/Register:** User signs in securely
2. **Set Encryption Key:** User sets or generates a key for chat/calls
3. **Start Chat/Call:** User connects with another user (by email)
4. **Send Messages/Files:** All data is encrypted before sending
5. **Make Calls:** Voice/video calls are encrypted end-to-end
6. **Encrypt/Decrypt Files/Text:** User can encrypt/decrypt files or text for secure storage or sharing

---

## 5. Security Model

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All communication and files are encrypted client-side
- **Key Management:** Only users with the correct key can decrypt data
- **No Plaintext on Server:** Server relays encrypted data only
- **Session Isolation:** Each chat/call session uses a unique key
- **Automatic Permission Handling:** Camera/mic/notifications requested as needed
